# CloudGuard Network Security for AWS Transit Gateway Demonstration 

Terraform scripts for transit gateway demonstration of CloudGuard in AWS \
Builds the complete environment with web and application servers, northbound and southbound e-w hubs \
See https://github.com/rcove/aws-tgw-r8040/blob/master/TGW%20POC%20v4.pdf for a diagram of the enviroment


---------------------------------------------------------------
*One time preparation of the AWS account*
1.	Create or choose a ssh key-pair in the account for the DC you are using \
2.	Subscribe to the ELUAs for R80.40 BYOL gateway and management \
    R80.30 R80.40 management \
    https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07KSBV1MM?qid=1558349960795&sr=0-4&ref_=srh_res_product_title

    R80.30 R80.40 Gateway \
    https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07LB3YN9P?qid=1558349960795&sr=0-5&ref_=srh_res_product_title

3.	In AWS, Create IAM access keys for the API login (for terraform) and save into credentials \
      shared_credentials_file = "~/.aws/credentials"  (linux) \
      shared_credentials_file = "%USERPROFILE%\\.aws\\credentials"  (windows) \
      see this blog for details: https://blog.gruntwork.io/authenticating-to-aws-with-the-credentials-file-d16c0fbcbf9e
      
4.  Ensure you have enough resources in the account, this script creates 6 VPC, 1 transit gateway and 12 instances (~20 cores), the cost for this will be a few dollars per hour, so it is recommended to destroy the resources when not using them, by default you can only create 5 VPC per region, log a resource request for more. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

One time preparation of the Terraform scripts 
Works with terraform v0.12.x 
1. Modify the variables.tf to suite your needs   
2. Delete Route53.tf if not needed and you dont have a route53 domain 
3. Run terraform init

Solution Documentation   

The terraform script deploys these 3 CloudFormation templates with all the glue to configure them \
  template_url        = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/CloudFormationTemplate/management.json" \
  template_url        = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/CloudFormationTemplate/checkpoint-tgw-asg-master.yaml" \
  template_url        = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/CloudFormationTemplate/autoscale.json"

* Modules  \
  checkpoint.tf   - Contains the CFT for the gateways and manager\
  tgw.tf\
  instances.tf\
  subnets.tf\
  vpc.tf\
  routes.tf\
  external_nlb.tf\
  external_alb.tf\
  internal_lb.tf        - app1\
  internal_lb_app2.tf   - app2\
  variables.tf\
  route53.tf        - Optional, delete if R53 is not used  

-------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the script in terrraform  
    terraform init\
    terraform apply - then yes to accept 

After about 30 mins you can Logon to the manager via the windows based Check Point SmartDashboard R80.40

To remove the environment

1. In the outbound autoscale group, set the instances to 0, 
2. wait a few minutes to allow instance and the site to site VPNs to be deleted, this will allow for terraform to delete the TGW 
3. run\
   terraform destroy \
 All assets will now be removed 

* Note: To use an existing manager \
Some modifications will be needed to terraform scripts and you will need to setup the CME and autoprov-cfg similar to the bootstrap commands.\
/etc/cloud-setup.sh (on the terraform built manager instance) will give you the autprov-cfg commands you need to run on an existing manger 

* Not for production \
Please note that these scripts are for demonstration in labs and are not production validated, \
you should make sure you validate and test them fully if you plan on using them in production (no refunds) 

Based on Check Point Network Security R80.40, for the older version tested with R80.30 go to https://github.com/rcove/TGW 

* Troubleshooting \
*On the manager:* \
 the logs for install are here: \
    first time install and startup script - /var/log/cloud-user-data.log \
 CME run log - \
    tail -f /var/log/CPcme/cme.log \
    *On the gateways:* \
    Sometimes you may need to reset SIC, ssh to the gateway and run cpconfig, set the password to equal the one in the variables \
    These are cattle not pets, sometimes just delete the instance and allow them to be replaced with a new one is the best bet
